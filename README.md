# RL-ADN: A High-Performance Deep Reinforcement Learning Environment for Optimal Energy Storage Systems Dispatch in Active Distribution Networks


## Abstract
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) presents a promising avenue for optimizing Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) dispatch in distribution networks. This paper introduces RL-ADN, an innovative open-source library specifically designed for solving the optimal ESSs dispatch in active distribution networks. RL-ADN offers unparalleled flexibility in modeling distribution networks, and ESSs, accommodating a wide range of research goals. A standout feature of RL-ADN is its data augmentation module, based on Gaussian Mixture Model and Copula (GMC) functions, elevating DRL agents' performance ceiling. Additionally, RL-ADN incorporates the Laurent power flow solver, significantly reducing the computational burden of power flow calculations during training without sacrificing accuracy. The effectiveness of RL-ADN is demonstrated using in different sizes of distribution networks, showing marked performance improvements in the adaptability of DRL algorithms for ESS dispatch tasks. This enhancement is particularly beneficial from the increased diversity of training scenarios. Furthermore, RL-ADN achieves a tenfold increase in computational efficiency during training, making it highly suitable for large-scale network applications. The library sets a new benchmark in DRL-based ESSs dispatch in distribution networks and it is poised to advance DRL applications in distribution network operations significantly.
